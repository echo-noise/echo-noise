### Hello, welcome!
...And forgive the mess! Still working on organizing my profile.
I'm a computer science student based in Brazil! 
I made this profile to register my studying progress as well as to receive feedback. For now most of my repositories are programming exercises, challenges and some uni projects.
I'm always open to learning new things!

* Currently studying: Native Android Development + Kotlin 
* Other interests: Python
